Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be
OPEN for extension but CLOSED for modification

Example: Adding new functionality to a system using
"inheritance" or "composition" without modifying existing
code.

In our example, we can add a new payment method say UPI without
modifying any of the classes made earlier.
