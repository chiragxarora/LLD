Interface Segregation Principle

Classes should not be burdened with the methods they
don't need. It promotes better design by breaking large
general-purpose interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

It improves maintainability, flexibility and testability by
ensuring that classes only have dependencies which they
actually require.
